      <p>Bohubrihi Restaurant was founded in 2023 by a group of friends who shared a love for food and culture. The name of the restaurant is inspired by the famous novel and TV series by Humayun Ahmed, which depicts the life and struggles of a middle-class family in Dhaka. The restaurant aims to capture the essence of Bohubrihi, which means "many dimensions" in Bengali, by offering a diverse and dynamic dining experience.
